I am an AI/ML Engineer specializing in architecting and scaling production-grade systems. During my time in B2B startups, I trained and deployed models that currently serve thousands of businesses globally. My technical footprint extends deep into the open-source ecosystem, most notably through high-impact contributions. Beyond traditional engineering, I build high-stakes automations for on-chain analysis and algorithmic trading within the Solana ecosystem systems designed to bypass security restrictions and operate at peak profitability. Currently, I am engineering advanced reasoning models and complex agentic pipelines to solve high-impact problems. I break systems to understand their limits, then build the machines that surpass them.
