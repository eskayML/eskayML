I'm samuel

I'm 16  years  old.

I had this passion for programming since I was a kid.

I started off with python programming 2 years ago  and I use it extensively  for building web applications with flask&django   and  also for data analysis

I'm also very  conversant  with  frontend web development using 
HTML
css
Js
Bootstrap
jQuery
And so on

I'm also a little groomed with cyber security and ethical hacking
